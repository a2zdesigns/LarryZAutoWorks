				<p>Larry'Z AutoWorks is a family-owned and operated business that was established in 1978 by Larry Zimmerman. With a love for and tinkering with automobiles, he set out to make a name for himself. He strived to provide quality repair with an honest outlook. Now with 40+ years in business, Larry'Z has become a well known name in the Sacramento area. In early 2000, Larry took his son, Aaron, under his wing and today Aaron continues to run the business. He carries on the tradition of a reliable and honest auto shop.  Larry'Z namesake passed away in 2019, but his name and legend lives on in the heart of Larry'Z AutoWorks.</p>
